# libraryAssist 

The aim is to replace barcode stickers with RFID stickers and develop dedicated hardware to read/write information into RFID memory using microcontroller, MiFare RC522 RFID reader/writer and Nextion HMI touch display as GUI.

For the current development Arduino Mega 2560 development board is used and Arduino programming language is used in programming.

The ultimate goal is to use develop the device so that it can be connected to any library management system with less effort of modification.

For the current development, MySQL database and Java Socket Server with Java Database Driver to connect and execute SQL queries are used.

ESP8266 Wi-Fi module is the communicating mode between Java server and microcontroller.
